Reflection on Projects in CS 300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The primary problem I addressed in these projects was designing and implementing a software application for the Computer Science department at ABC University (ABCU) to assist advisors in managing and retrieving course information. This included creating an efficient system to load, store, sort, and search for course data using various data structures, such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. The goal was to provide functionality to display course information, including prerequisites, in a user-friendly manner.
How did you approach the problem?

I approached the problem by leveraging data structures to optimize the storage and retrieval of course data. Understanding the trade-offs of different data structures was critical. For example:

    Vector: Provided simple indexing and storage, suitable for ordered data.
    Hash Table: Allowed for fast lookups, ideal for quick searches by course number.
    Binary Search Tree: Enabled efficient alphanumeric ordering and in-order traversal for sorted output.

I also broke the problem into smaller tasks, such as loading data, validating input, sorting, and displaying course information. Each task was tackled incrementally, adhering to modular programming principles.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Roadblocks included file reading errors, handling edge cases (e.g., courses with no prerequisites), and ensuring data consistency. To overcome these challenges:

    I validated file paths and formats before processing.
    I implemented robust error handling to manage unexpected input and ensure meaningful feedback to users.
    Debugging tools and test cases helped identify and resolve issues incrementally.

I also referred back to pseudocode and prior assignments to reuse and adapt previously tested logic, which streamlined the development process.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has taught me the importance of planning and designing before coding. Writing pseudocode helped me visualize the program flow and understand the relationships between components. I also learned the value of choosing the right data structure based on the requirements of the problem, as this directly impacts the program's performance and scalability.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Through this project, I have developed a stronger emphasis on maintainable and readable code. This includes:

    Commenting: Explaining the purpose and functionality of critical sections of the code.
    Naming Conventions: Using clear and consistent variable and function names to improve readability.
    Modular Design: Breaking the program into reusable functions and adhering to the single-responsibility principle.

I now appreciate the importance of designing software with future adaptability in mind, ensuring the code can be extended or modified with minimal effort.
